This is my personal repo based on the VIS Media assignment.

The game is taken from this github repo: https://github.com/Oshan96/OpenFighting. All credit unless said other wise is to thier creation.

Things to note:
1 storypoint is equal to an half hour.
You will see two contributers: L00182257 and Noahrock910. Both are me. L00182257 is usually mean accesing github on the browser while noahrock910 is me locally on my laptop.
